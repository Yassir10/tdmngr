It's true that there are a lot of todo list web and mobile apps and one does not need to reinvent the wheel by making another todo list app. The goal of developing this app was at the beginning to learn React and simply have fun. However, I started to use it everyday to manage my todo list and it turned out that it was very helpful in my everyday life. Using this app I can add a new task, check the completed task and delete the not anymore relevant apps. Furthermore, I can also select the completed, the uncompleted, or simply all the tasks. The tasks are stored in local storage in the browser.
